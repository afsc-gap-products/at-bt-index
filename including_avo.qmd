## Background

We decided to explore adding the AVO as a third gear type to provide information about the rest of the water column when only a bottom trawl (BT) survey occurred. When there is no midwater information, the uncertainty around the BT estimate increases dramatically. We are hoping that the AVO will decrease this uncertainty and avoid essentially downweighting the BT data.

Cole's paper divided the water column into three layers:

> "We define depth layer c=1 between bottom 0.5 m, c=2 between 0.5 and 16m off bottom (the effective fishing height), and c=3 between 16m off bottom and 16m below the surface, with a corresponding total vertical density (in kg/km2) d=d~1~+d~2~+d~3~, where dc is expected density in depth layer c. Then the acoustic gear samples from d~2~ (data set referred to as “AT2”) and d~3~ (data set “AT3”), both of which are separated in post-processing as described above, whereas the BT samples from d~1~+d~2~ combined, with no ability to post-process data to c=1 and c=2 separately. Note that both gears sample from c=2, the overlap layer, and this is a key structural feature of our model."

Nate has processed the AVO data for 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014-2019, and 2021-2024 into 1m intervals. **The AVO data are not, however, available below 3m**. Therefore, we have re-stratified the model to include four depth layers, sampled by the surveys as follows:

-   Below 0.5m from the bottom (BT only)

-   0.5m - 3m from the bottom (BT and AT)

-   3m - 16m from the bottom (BT, AT, and AVO)

-   16m from the bottom - 16m from the surface (AT and AVO)

Below are the results for the original 3-layer model, the 4-layer model with the AVO included, and a series of sensitivities to removing the 3-16m and \>16m AVO layers.

## Model with 4 depth layers and the AVO

When the AVO is included, the uncertainty for both the BT and AT surveys significantly increases in years without the AVO (Figure 2). These years (2011 and 2013) are available, but have not been processed. Including the AVO also changes the estimated proportion available to the AT survey in some years, corresponding to an increase in the proportion of pollock below 0.5m (Fig. 2).

The increase in uncertainty in years without the AVO index appears to result from the uncertainty in the \<0.5m depth layer(Fig. 3).

## Sensitivities

We also ran the model with four layers and no AVO, exluding the 3-16m AVO layer, and excluding the \>16m AVO layer. The proportion available to the acoustic trawl surveys was relatively consistent, with an increase in uncertainty for years without an acoustic survey (2015 and 2017) when the \>16m AVO layer was excluded (and when all AVO was excluded; Fig. 4).

This increase in uncertainty when the \>16m AVO layer was removed is again due to an increase in uncertainty in the \<0.5 depth layer (Fig. 5). When the 3-16m AVO layer was removed, there was an increase in the estimated biomass in the 0.5-3m layer and a decrease in the 3-16m layer in 2017, a year without an acoustic survey (Fig. 5).

## Next steps

We are continuing to develop diagnostics for the model and exploring whether to include correlations across depth layers. We will also be expanding the time-series. Eventually, we will explore options for including the index in some form in the pollock assessment.
