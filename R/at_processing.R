#' The real trick here is that we can't simply drop the non-pollock and sum

#' those cases as zeroes for P. Another weird case is when the hit the shelf 
#' and the bottom is unknown, so that we have no reference point and the depths 
#' are incorrect. In this case I need to assume all those fish are in the top 
#' stratum and backfill zeroes for the bottom two strata. It is **very** 
#' important to maintain these zeroes as they are real and explicitly modeled in VAST.

#' There's two cases we should check. First  when the max depth is really big, 
#' which happens when the survey goes past the slope and cant find the bottom 
#' and so the software has weird depths. The second is really shallow water such 
#' that the three depth strata arent even covered.

#' So first sum across layers for all unique keys to get the three model strata 
#' for each location (interval and year) and pollock nonpollock
